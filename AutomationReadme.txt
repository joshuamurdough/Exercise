I used postman to do some simple automation, just general checks.  In order to run the tests:

Start the Broken-hashserve program.
Click the link https://www.getpostman.com/collections/1b2efedd93dc11199a88 or open the collection contained in this folder (Broken-hashserve.postman_collection.json)
Close any windows other than the main postman window or login if asked.
Click the Runner tab at the top.
Select the Broken-hashserver collection.
Click Run Broken-hashserver.
There should be 2 failures, corresponding to the first two bugs.
